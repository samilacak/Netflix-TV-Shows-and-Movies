# Netflix-TV-Shows-and-Movies

The Netflix TV Shows and Movies dataset provides comprehensive information about various titles available on the popular streaming platform. The dataset includes details such as the title's name, its type (whether it is a TV show or a movie), a brief description of the content, the year it was released, age certification rating, runtime (for TV shows: length of episodes; for movies: duration), IMDb score, and IMDb votes.

By analyzing this dataset, we can gain insights into the distribution of IMDb scores and ratings for both TV shows and movies available on Netflix. This information can help us understand the popularity and reception of titles based on user ratings.

The dataset has been carefully curated to ensure accuracy and relevance. It excludes any null values in IMDb scores to maintain data integrity. Each entry also contains an ID that corresponds to JustWatch (a platform for legal streaming) as well as the respective title ID on IMDb.

To visualize the distribution of IMDb scores effectively, we will be using histograms. Histograms categorize data into bins or intervals based on a chosen metric (in this case: IMDb score). The length of each bar within a bin represents the number of titles falling within that particular range of scores. With correct binning techniques, we can observe patterns and trends in how different shows and movies are rated by viewers.

When creating your visualization using Tableau or any other tool you prefer, feel free to experiment with color schemes to enhance your chart's visual impact without overshadowing its analytical purpose. However, remember not to sacrifice clarity and simplicity in pursuit of creativity.

We encourage you to take your time in crafting an insightful visualization over the next week. Once completed, share it on Tableau Public or through social media platforms like Twitter or LinkedIn using #B2VB hashtag while tagging ReadySetData and ItsElisaDavis for recognition. Don't forget to fill out our submission form on Back 2 Viz Basics website to officially participate in the challenge.

Best of luck, and we look forward to seeing your visualization!
